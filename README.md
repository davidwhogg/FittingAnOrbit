## Projects
- The goal is to write a short paper for *AAS Journals* or *RNAAS*.
- The main idea is that parameterization matters when fitting orbits, and we have better parameterizations.
- Good parameterizations for MCMC are likely to be good for optimization too.
- We are currently working on radial-velocity data, but probably we should think about astrometric and timing data too.
